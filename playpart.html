        <h1>Lakshmi Manasa acts in a play</h1>
        <h2>A Doll’s House by Henrik Ibsen</h2>
        <p>
            <pre>
            NORA.
            Whatever is that?
            
            HELMER.
            His moral failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if necessary—
            
            NORA.
            Yes, you could—couldn’t you?
            
            HELMER.
            And I hear he is a good worker, too. But I knew him when we were boys.
            It was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an incubus in
            afterlife. I may as well tell you plainly, we were once on very
            intimate terms with one another. But this tactless fellow lays no
            restraint on himself when other people are present. On the contrary, he
            thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me, and
            every minute it is “I say, Helmer, old fellow!” and that sort of thing.
            I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He would make my position
            in the Bank intolerable.
            
            NORA.
            Torvald, I don’t believe you mean that.
            
            HELMER.
            Don’t you? Why not?
            
            NORA.
            Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.
            
            HELMER.
            What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am narrow-minded?
            
            NORA.
            No, just the opposite, dear—and it is exactly for that reason.
            
            HELMER.
            It’s the same thing. You say my point of view is narrow-minded, so I
            must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well—I must put an end to this.
            _[Goes to the hall door and calls.]_ Helen!
            
            NORA.
            What are you going to do?
            
            HELMER.
            _[looking among his papers]_. Settle it. _[Enter MAID.]_ Look here;
            take this letter and go downstairs with it at once. Find a messenger
            and tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The address is on it, and
            here is the money.
            
            MAID.
            Very well, sir. _[Exit with the letter.]_
        
            HELMER.
            _[putting his papers together]_. Now then, little Miss Obstinate.
            
            NORA.
            _[breathlessly]_. Torvald—what was that letter?
            
            HELMER.
            Krogstad’s dismissal.
            
            NORA.
            Call her back, Torvald! There is still time. Oh Torvald, call her back!
            Do it for my sake—for your own sake—for the children’s sake! Do you
            hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don’t know what that letter can
            bring upon us.
            
            HELMER.
            It’s too late.
            
            NORA.
            Yes, it’s too late.
