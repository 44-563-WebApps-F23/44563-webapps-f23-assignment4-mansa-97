        <p class="speech">My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in, although really it
        is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn’t it an insult to think that I
        should be afraid of a starving quill-driver’s vengeance? But I forgive
        you nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to your great
        love for me.</p><p class="direction"> _[Takes her in his arms.]_ </p><p class="speech">And that is as it should be, my
        own darling Nora.</p>
